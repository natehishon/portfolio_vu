                Course Description:<br>
                This course studies the design, development, and publication of client-side web applications.

                Students will acquire an awareness of different client-side design and development methods,
                technologies, and techniques suitable for the development of web applications.

                The course has been structured to provide logical groupings of common technologies, which complement
                each other in the development of modern client-side applications. The student will begin by developing
                fundamental skills and knowledge in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and JSON. This allows a student to then
                progress to the more advanced implementations of current client-side technologies including React,
                D3.js, and other suitable JS based libraries.

                We shall also consider client-side usage of tools and technologies such as Node.js, Express, and
                Mongoose. These technologies will be considered primarily from the client-side perspective with
                complimentary introductions to data stores such as Redis, MongoDB, and Firebase.

                Spring 2020<br>
                Course Description:<br>
                This course studies the interaction between humans and computer-based systems. The course will provide
                students with the methods for evaluating, designing, and developing better interfaces between humans and
                computer-based systems.

                Students will acquire an awareness of different design and evaluation methods as well as practical,
                effective, and cost-conscience methods for improving systems and their interfaces.

                The course has been structured to provide logical, contiguous groupings of material relative to
                considerations of design and human interaction with computer-based systems. The student is exposed to
                design components and elements that help us develop interactions with such systems. This is complemented
                by a sound and clear understanding of the logic and psychological reasoning for such patterns and design
                choices. Examples are available throughout the course, and theory is offered alongside demonstration.

                Abstract:<br>
                Employment among autistic individuals is an area of noted difficulty, with an employment rate well below
                the general population [1]. Several barriers attributed to autistic unemployment, including difficulties
                communicating with employers and social interactions with coworkers, obsessive adherence to routine, and
                trouble organizing and completing workplace tasks, are also attributed to challenges in maintaining
                employment [2]. Several studies have concluded that long-term employment support is necessary to acquire
                and maintain autistic employment [3]. The noted benefit of intensive job training, such as access to job
                coaches, indicates the need for further support to help autistic individuals complete workplace tasks
                and maintain employment, as well as employers in their support of autistic employees [4]. Therefore, the
                development of client-side software that facilitates communication and clarifies workplace duties may be
                a more long-term, sustainable solution. The object of this research is to develop a workplace e-learning
                web application designed to support autistic employees and their managers. The Wayfinder application
                aims to accommodate not only the employee in their day-to-day task management, communication, and
                independence, but also the manager as they help to actively include autistic employees in their
                workforce. This research takes place over the course of a year including initial concept, research, and
                application development. Key screen captures of the prototype application are included with research
                driven functionality highlighted. References [1]P. Howlin, S. Goode, J. Hutton, and M. Rutter, “Adult
