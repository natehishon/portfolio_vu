                        complement
                        each other in the development of modern client-side applications. The student will begin by
                        developing
                        fundamental skills and knowledge in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and JSON. This allows a student
                        to then
                        progress to the more advanced implementations of current client-side technologies including
                        React,
                        D3.js, and other suitable JS based libraries.

                        We shall also consider client-side usage of tools and technologies such as Node.js, Express, and
                        Mongoose. These technologies will be considered primarily from the client-side perspective with
                        complimentary introductions to data stores such as Redis, MongoDB, and Firebase.

                        Spring 2020<br>
                        Course Description:<br>
                        This course studies the interaction between humans and computer-based systems. The course will
                        provide
                        students with the methods for evaluating, designing, and developing better interfaces between
                        humans and
                        computer-based systems.

                        Students will acquire an awareness of different design and evaluation methods as well as
                        practical,
                        effective, and cost-conscience methods for improving systems and their interfaces.

                        The course has been structured to provide logical, contiguous groupings of material relative to
                        considerations of design and human interaction with computer-based systems. The student is
                        exposed to
                        design components and elements that help us develop interactions with such systems. This is
                        complemented
                        by a sound and clear understanding of the logic and psychological reasoning for such patterns
                        and design
                        choices. Examples are available throughout the course, and theory is offered alongside
                        demonstration.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                        Employment among autistic individuals is an area of noted difficulty, with an employment rate
                        well below
                        the general population. Several barriers attributed to autistic unemployment, including
                        difficulties
                        communicating with employers and social interactions with coworkers, obsessive adherence to
                        routine, and
                        trouble organizing and completing workplace tasks, are also attributed to challenges in
                        maintaining
                        employment. Several studies have concluded that long-term employment support is necessary to
                        acquire
                        and maintain autistic employment. The noted benefit of intensive job training, such as access to
                        job
                        coaches, indicates the need for further support to help autistic individuals complete workplace
                        tasks
                        and maintain employment, as well as employers in their support of autistic employees. Therefore,
                        the
                        development of client-side software that facilitates communication and clarifies workplace
                        duties may be
                        a more long-term, sustainable solution. The object of this research is to develop a workplace
                        e-learning
                        web application designed to support autistic employees and their managers. The Wayfinder
                        application
                        aims to accommodate not only the employee in their day-to-day task management, communication,
                        and
                        independence, but also the manager as they help to actively include autistic employees in their
                        workforce. This research takes place over the course of a year including initial concept,
                        research, and
                        application development. Key screen captures of the prototype application are included with
                        research
                        driven functionality highlighted.
